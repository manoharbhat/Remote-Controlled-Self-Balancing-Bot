# Remote-Controlled-Self-Balancing-Bot

A PID controlled self balancing robot that can climb inclined slopes and pick up and drop boxes. Sensor fusion of motor position encoders and IMU is used to efficiently overcome the drift in the position and stay stable. Kalman filtering is used to filter the data and provide the tilt angle to the controller. This controller was developed using both LQR and PID techniques.
